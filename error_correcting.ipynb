    "# Introduction\n",
    "Whenever we transmit data between two parties the data might get altered for different reasons. We call these modifications **errors**. And there are two mechanisms to handle these errors - first is **error detection** and second is **error correction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error detection\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are using 4-bit BCD data representation (Binary Coded Decimal). And during data transmission a `0011` 4-bit chunk becomes `0001`. In this case both these are valid BCD values (`1` and `3`). However, what if the `1001` chunk becomes `1011`? In this case, the receiver will detect the error, since `1011` does not appear in the BCD decoding table.\n",
    "\n",
    "![BCD Error Detection](img/error_correcting/error_detection_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why we need to come up with a smart way to detect errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distance in error detection\n",
    "And here comes the **distance** in error detection. Distance in error detection measures the difference between two valid codes. In the following example the *distance* between two valid codes is $2$, because at least $2$ bits must be altered in order to get a new valid code. \n",
    "This way we will detect all **1-bit errors** with 100% certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Distance in Error Detection](img/error_correcting/error_detection_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another name for distance in error detection is **Hamming distance**. The formal definition of **Hamming distance** is:\n",
    "* *The Hamming distance is a metric used to measure the difference between two strings of equal length. Specifically, it counts the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols differ. In the context of parity, Hamming distance can be used to evaluate error detection and correction capabilities.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Redundancy\n",
    "Another technique for error detection is adding **redundancy bits** to the original message and trasmitting them altogether. This way the receiver can execute a **generating function** over the received message and compare the result to the extra redundancy bits, which have been sent as well. If the redundancy check pass, then no error was detected. If the redundancy bits differ from the bits, generated on the receiver side, then an error has been detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Redundancy check](img/error_correcting/error_detection_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Four types of redundancy checks are used in data communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Vertical Redundancy Check (VRC)\n",
    "In VRC, a parity bit (a redundant bit) is added to each data unit. The parity bit is chosen such that the total number of 1s in the unit (including the parity bit) becomes even. The receiver then checks the received unit for even parity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the receiver counts an even number of 1s, the data unit is considered valid.\n",
    "* If the receiver counts an odd number of 1s, an error is detected, and the entire data unit is rejected.\n",
    "Odd parity VRC can also be implemented where the total number of 1s should be odd before transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Longitudinal Redundancy Check (LRC)\n",
    "LRC organizes data into a table of rows and columns. Instead of sending a block of bits directly, it’s arranged into rows and columns. Parity bits are then calculated for each column, forming a new row of parity bits. This row of parity bits is appended to the original data before transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Longitudinal Redundancy Check](img/error_correcting/lrc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)\n",
    "\n",
    "CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) involves a more complex calculation. At the transmitter, CRC bits are calculated based on the data block and appended to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the receiver, the CRC is recalculated based on the received data block and compared with the received CRC. If the calculated CRC matches the received CRC, the frame is considered error-free. If they don’t match, an error is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the figure below, $k$ bits are passed to the encoder to generate parity bits $(n-k)$. These parity bits are added to the input data bits and are transmitted as $n$ bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the receiver, the parity bits along with the data bits are passed to the encoder. From the data part CRC is again computed and will be compared with the received CRC bits. Based on this comparison, the receiver determines if the data is corrupted or not. This process is called error detection and correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Cyclic Redundancy Check](img/error_correcting/crc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Checksum\n",
    "\n",
    "This method uses two main components: a *checksum generator* and a *checksum checker*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transmitter (Checksum Generator):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data unit is divided into equal segments of $n$ bits (typically 16 bits).\n",
    "2. These segments are added together using one’s complement arithmetic, resulting in an $n$-bit sum.\n",
    "3. The sum is then complemented, and this complemented value (the checksum) is appended to the original data unit as redundant bits.\n",
    "4. The extended data unit is transmitted. So if the sum of the data segment is equal to $T$, the checksum will be $-T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Receiver (Checksum Checker):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The receiver divides the received data unit in the same way.\n",
    "2. It adds all the segments together, including the checksum, and then complements the result.\n",
    "3. If the extended data unit is intact, the total value found by adding all data segments and the checksum should be $0$.\n",
    "4. If the result is not $0$, the packet contains an error, and the receiver rejects it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Checksum](img/error_correcting/checksum.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below an example of checksum calculation is presented.\n",

    "### Error correction\n",
    "In case of failed redundancy check the receiver side might request the sender to **repeat the data transfer**. This is an example of **error correction** technique. Alternatively, the receiver might use **error distance** for assuming the correct data. In addition the received might use an **error-correcting code** for automatic correction of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Distance in error correction\n",
    "Distance could be used to assume what was the sent data in case an error occurs. We can pick the closest valid code in such case and assume this was the data being sent.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Distance in Error Correction](img/error_correcting/error_correction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using math induction we can easily conclude that for $n$-bit error detection the *hamming distance* must be $\\geq(n+1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error-correcting code\n",
    "\n",
    "An error-correcting code (ECC) is an encoding scheme that transmits messages as binary numbers, in such a way that the message can be recovered even if some bits are erroneously flipped. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Repeating the message\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example of an ECC is repeating the message: when a bit is to be transmitted, it is instead transmitted multiple times (usually 3), with the bit transmitted more times being interpreted as the intended message. More specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Received Message | Interpreted bit |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| 000 | 0 |\n",
    "| 001 | 0 |\n",
    "| 010 | 0 |\n",
    "| 100 | 0 |\n",
    "| 011 | 1 |\n",
    "| 101 | 1 |\n",
    "| 110 | 1 |\n",
    "| 111 | 1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A (very) **noisy channel** is known to flip bits 20% of the time. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code is called the (3,1) repetition code, meaning that three bits are sent, one of which is the desired data bit. It can correct a message when one of the transmitted bits is flipped - a single bit error - meaning that the **correcting ability** of this code is 1 bit. It can also detect an error occurred if at most two bits are flipped, meaning that the **detecting ability** of this code is 2 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this encoding scheme is fairly inefficient, as it requires the sender to transmit three times the message's length in order to achieve single bit correction. More formally, the **code rate** of this code is $1/3 - $ the number of data bits divided by the number of transmitted bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parity code\n",
    "\n",
    "An even simpler example of a repetition code is the **parity code**, in which each bit is transmitted **twice**:\n",
    "| Message | Encoding |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| 0 | 00 |\n",
    "| 1 | 11 |\n",
    "\n",
    "It can detect, but not correct, $1$-bit errors. The importance of this code lies in the concept of a **parity bit**, which is a bit added to make the number of 1s in each encoding even.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parity bit\n",
    "Parity bit is a technique that increases the hamming distance in a existing code by $1$. More specifically, the parity bit is an extra bit added to a binary string to ensure that the total number of 1's is even (even parity) or odd (odd parity). For example, for the binary string `1101`, the parity bit for even parity would be `1` (since there are three existing 1's, making the total number of 1's four).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Parity Bit](img/error_correcting/parity_bit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hamming Code\n",
    "Hamming codes are a family of error-correcting codes. Hamming codes can detect 1-bit and 2-bit errors and correct 1-bit errors. By contrast, the simple *parity code* cannot correct errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, **Hamming(7,4)** is a linear error-correcting code that encodes `4` bits of data into `7` bits by adding `3` parity bits. It is a member of a larger family of Hamming codes, but the term Hamming code often refers to this specific code that Richard W. Hamming introduced in 1950.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for determining the number of needed parity bits is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2^p \\geq (p + m) + 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the number of positions required for representing the *message*. and $p$ is the number of parity bits (positions).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Parity Bit](img/error_correcting/hamming_code_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the number of parity bits, we must place them on the correct places and there is a mechanism for determining these places (1,2,4,8, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Parity Bit](img/error_correcting/hamming_code_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the algorithm is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When transmitting a binary number, use the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th, etc. (all powers of two) bits as parity bits, and all other positions as data bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The parity bit at $2^n$ is the sum of all bits (taken *modulo 2*) whose positions have the $n$-th least significant bit set to $1$. For example, the parity bit at $2$ is the sum of the bits at positions $3 = 11_2 , 6 = 110_2 , 7 = 111_2 , 10 = 1010_2 , 11 = 1011_2 $ ,... , since these positions all have the $2$-nd rightmost bit set to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Transmit this entire message. If an error in a data bit occurred, some of the parity bits will show an error (since there would be an odd number of 1s in some of these sets). Their sum is the location of the error. If only one parity bit shows an error, that parity bit was in fact in error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point is that every bit is encoded in a unique set of parity bits: specifically, the ones for which the binary representation of the bit's position is a $1$. For example, the $14$-th bit is included in the parity bits at $8$, $4$, and $2$, since $14 = 1110_2$ . If parity bits $8$, $4$, and $2$ show an error, then the $14$-th bit is in error.\n"

    "# Observation\n",
    "\n",
    "With $n$ parity bits, $2^n - n - 1$ bits are usable for data, meaning that up to $2^{2^n - n - 1}$ different members of an alphabet can be encoding using just $n$ parity bits. This is a vast improvement on repetition codes when $n>2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it can correct single-bit errors and detect double-bit errors, this makes Hamming codes far more efficient than repetition codes while achieving the same purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space efficiency\n",
    "The transmissions efficiency goes up as the block size increases. In **Hamming(7, 4)**, the effective data rate is $0.571$, while **Hamming(255, 247)** is $0.969$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error probability\n",
    "In terms of Bit Error Rate (BER) or error probability Hamming(7,4) can handle up to 14,2% of errors. In other words 1-bit in every 7 could be altered during transmission and the Hamming Code will auto-correct them. Surely, only if these errors occur in different data chunks (i.e. 1-bit errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use **Hamming(255, 247)** we will increase the transfer efficiency, but decrease the BER.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time efficiency\n",
    "Due to their simple implementation the Hamming coders/encoders are quite fast and does not introduce sever computational overhead."

    "\n",
    "We got familiar with *error detection* and *error correction*. Furthermore, we delved into the four types of redundancy checks for identifying data transmission errors. Afterwards, we deepdived into different error correction techniques like *message repeating* and *parity bits*. We studied *Hamming distance* and *Hamming code*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we implemented **Hamming(7, 4)** in Python and demonstrated its space and time efficiency."
