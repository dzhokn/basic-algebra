    "### Set Equivalence Theory\n",

    "Have you played Sudoku? It used to be quite popular, and it still is; with boards that range from very simple to extremely complex. From random grannies, to the most brilliant computer scientists and mathematicians - everyone can get a kick out of a well-made puzzle. Sudoku has a lot of variants which make solving very fun and challenging, but let's focus on the classic variant now.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the game, you must fill a 9x9 board with digits 1-9, once each in every row, every column, and every 3x3 region (or \"box\", or sometimes called \"house\"). You can find some example boards [here](https://sandiway.arizona.edu/sudoku/examples.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most interesting solving techniques comes from the so-called SET (or set equivalence theory; we love recursive acronyms...). It consists of finding set unions and intersections which lead to equivalent sets. Let's look at an example:\n",
    "1. Consider $S_1 = R_1 \\cup R_2$ - 2 sets of digits 1-9 in some order\n",
    "2. Also consider $S_2 = C_1 \\cup C_2$ - also 2 sets of digits 1-9 in some order\n",
    "3. $\\{R1C1, R1C2, R2C1, R2C2\\} \\in S_1 \\cap S_2$\n",
    "4. Since we started with identical sets and removed the same elements from both, the remaining elements (colored red and blue in the figure below) must also be the same. We don't know the order, but we know they **must** contain the same digits.\n",

    "![An example of SET](img/sudoku/sudoku.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, use this newly acquired knowledge to prove the following two figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find appropriate sets, think about unions, intersections, and differences (e.g., in the figure above, the colored squares represent the differences of the sets). I think you should be able to outline a proof using LaTeX only, but a coding solution would also work. You're free to choose the approach.\n",
