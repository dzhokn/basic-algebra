    "## What is a ring\n",

    "A ring is a nonempty set $R$ with two binary operations (usually written as **addition** and **multiplication**) such that for all $a, b, c ∈ R$ :\n",
    "1. $R$ is closed under addition: $a + b ∈ R$.\n",
    "2. Addition is associative: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$.\n",

    "4. $R$ contains an additive identity element, called zero and usually denoted by $0$ or $0_R: a +0=0+ a = a $.\n",
    "5. Every element of $R$ has an additive inverse: for each $a$, there exists an $x ∈ R$ such that $a + x =0= x + a$. We write $x = −a$.\n",
    "6. $R$ is closed under multiplication: $ab ∈ R$.\n",
    "7. Multiplication is associative: $(ab)c = a(bc)$.\n",

    "### Detailed definition\n",
    "A **field** is a **set** of objects (usually numbers) on which **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication** and **division** operations are defined and behave as the corresponding operations on rational and real numbers. A field is thus a algebraic structure which is widely used in algebra, number theory, and many other areas of mathematics. Examples are, the set of all **real numbers**, , the set of all **complex numbers**, the set of all **rational numbers**.\n",

    "## Galois field (GF)\n",
    "In mathematics, a finite field or Galois field is a field that contains a finite number of elements. As with any field, a finite field is a set on which the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are defined and satisfy certain basic rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "### GF Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Finite size\n",
    "Unlike the set of all real numbers or integers, a Galois field has a limited number of elements. For example, it might only have 3 elements: ${0, 1, 2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Addition and multiplication work like a loop\n",
    "If the result goes outside the set, it *“wraps around”* (kind of like how hours on a clock wrap from 12 back to 1). For example, in a field with 3 elements $GF(3): 2 + 1 = 3$ , but since we only have ${0, 1, 2}$, it becomes $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Prime and power sizes \n",
    "A Galois field always has a size that is either a prime number, e.g. $GF(2)$, which only has ${0, 1}$, or a power of a prime, e.g. $GF(2^2)$ with $4$ elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. No weird exceptions\n",
    "Every non-zero element has an inverse (something that multiplies with it to give 1). For example, in $GF(5)$ with elements ${0, 1, 2, 3, 4}$, the inverse of $3$ is $2$ since $3 \\cdot 2 = 6$, which wraps back to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### GF(2)\n",
    "Let's define $GF(2)$ as a field of 2 elements. Since a field needs to contain and additive identity $0$ and a multiplicative identity $1$, then $GF(2)$ needs to contain both $\\{0,1\\}$.\n",

    "## GF applications\n",
    "For symmetric cryptography using a binary galois field results in fast operations. Thus, GF is being extensively used in symmetric encryption (e.g. AES).\n",

    "## Perfect secrecy \n",
    "Perfect Secrecy means that the *ciphertext* conveys no information about the content of the *plaintext*. In effect this means that, no matter how much *ciphertext* you have, it does not convey anything about what the *plaintext* and *key* are. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have 2 participants: Alice and Bob. Suppose we have a passive eavesdropper Eve who can receive any message passed through the channel, but cannot alter the message being passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get a message $M$ and use the encryption algorithm $E$ to produce the ciphertext $C = E(M)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The encryption scheme provides a perfect secrecy if the message $C$ is undistinguishable from the white noise and you cannot extract any information about the message $M$ from the ciphertext $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eve (even with infinite computational resources) can keep guessing keys and calculating the appropriate plaintext until every key has been tested. Supposing the message was $b$ bits long, this would leave her with $2^b$ possible keys, each of which would generate a unique plaintext, making $2^b$ plaintexts in total. \n",
    "\n",
    "A perfectly secret cipher has a couple of other equivalent properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Even if given a choice of two plaintexts, one the real one, for a ciphertext, you cannot distinguish which plaintext is the real one (perfect message indistinguishability)\n",
    "* There is a key that encrypts every possible plaintext to every possible ciphertext (perfect key ambiguity) (* this is true only if the keys used are the same size as the messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What perfect secrecy means in practice is that no amount of computation applied to the ciphertext will give you any advantage in knowing anything about the plaintext or key. This is obviously a desirable property of a cipher, and perfectly secret ciphers do exist: e.g. **One-time pad**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of perfect secrecy is that it can be shown that no cipher where the keys used are shorter than the plaintext can be perfectly secret, so in effect you've simply changed the problem of transmitting a message securely from the transmission of the plaintext to the transmission of the key. (**One-time pad** has this problem, and other practical problems as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, outside niche applications that can use **One-time pad**, ciphers tend to have keys much shorter (typically between 128 and a few thousand bits) than the messages we encrypt. These ciphers of course cannot have perfect secrecy (since the key is shorter than the message) and so can (especially when broken) succumb to computational attacks (some practical, some theoretical) that leak information about plaintexts and even keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the relatively weaker (but still practically very strong) notions of [Semantic Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_security) or [Ciphertext indistinguishability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext_indistinguishability) to evaluate and describe the security of non perfect-secrecy ciphers under various scenarios. The strength of a not-perfectly-secret cipher is generally expressed in terms of the computational complexity (in calculations and/or memory) of the best known attacks that break the cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-time pad\n",
    "Imagine Alice wants to deliver a 20-letters message to Bob. This is equivalent to picking one specific page from the **message space**. The message space could be thought of as a complete collection of all possible 20-letters messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Alice applies a shared key which is a list of 20-randomly generated shifts (pads) from 1 to 26 (the number of letters in English alphabet).\n",
    "$$ 7, 3, 19, 27, 5, 21, 23, 2, 14, 3, 8, 13, 9, 22, 7, 15, 10, 1, 24, 26$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **key space** is the complete collection of all possible outcomes. So, generating a key is equivalent to selecting a page from this keys stack at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "When she applies the shifts to encrypt a message, she ends up with a ciphertext. The **ciphertext space** represents all possible results of an encryption. When she applies the key, it maps to a unique page in this stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "![OTP Spaces](img/galois/otp_spaces.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $ Size(message space) = Size(key space) = Size(ciphertext space) = 26 ^{20}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if someone has access to a page of the ciphertext only, the only thing that they know is that every message is **equally likely**. So, no amount of computation power can could ever help improve a blind guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that requires the use of a single-use **pre-shared** key that is larger than or equal to the size of the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting ciphertext is impossible to decrypt or break if the following four conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The key must be at least as long as the plaintext.\n",
    "* The key must be truly random.\n",
    "* The key must never be reused in whole or in part.\n",
    "* The key must be kept completely secret by the communicating parties.\n",

    "#### Hash\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we would like to know what **hash** is. A hash is simply the output of a **hash function**. A hash function is a one-way function that is easy (fast) to compute on any given input, but extremely difficult to reverse engineer and obtain the original input from its hash value alone.\n",

    "If a hacker access a hash value (e.g. hashed password), she can look up for the reversed value in a pre-computed hash table (in case of endless computational power someone might pre-compute all possible passwords and their corresponding hashes). Mild solution for this problem is a random number/string (**salt**), which is being added (concatenated) to the password before being hashed. This makes the reverse operation a little bit harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Hash Salt](img/galois/hash_salt.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Symmetric encryption\n",
    "A symmetric encryption is any technique where the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ceaser Cipher\n",
    "The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the simplest symmetric encryption techniques, and of course, one of the easiest to crack.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Ceaser Cipher](img/galois/ceaser_cipher.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Vigenère Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vigenère Cipher is a little bit more sophisticated. Imagine that we want to encrypt the phrase VERSAILLES and use a shift key of CHEESE.\n",
    "First, we need to repeat the shift key to line up with each of the letters in the phrase:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Vigenere Cipher](img/galois/vigenere_cipher.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we replace each letter of the original text according to the Vigenère rule. Shift the letter with the index of the key. In this case \"V\" is being shifted twice (the index of \"C\" is 2) and the result is \"X\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![Vigenere Cipher 2](img/galois/vigenere_cipher_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And decryption happens with the same Vigenere rule (same key).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vigenère Cipher is a type of polyalphabetic cipher, and it's a harder code to crack than the Caesar Cipher due to the use of an entire shift word.\n",
    "If an intercepter had no idea what the shift key was and wanted to brute force their way to a decryption, they would need to try out all the possible shift words in the world, and perhaps even made-up words! For a mere mortal, that could take a lifetime. That's much more work than brute forcing the Caesar Cipher, where we just had to check 26 different shift amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Frequency analysis\n",
    "What about frequency analysis? Do messages encrypted with the Vigenere cipher have a special pattern in their distribution of letters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the frequency analysis of the original message is exactly what we'd expect for an English-language message: \"E\" is the most popular letter, and there is huge variance in the frequency of the letters. Thus, Vigenere cipher does not satisfy the **perfect secrecy** requirement (cipher text must not provide any information about the original message or the key).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Frequency Analysis](img/galois/freq_analysis.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1800s, people finally figured out different ways to use frequency analysis to crack the cipher. For example, in a long message, a short word like \"THE\" may get translated to the same three encrypted letters multiple times (just not every time), and that reveals possible lengths for the shift key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the use of powerful computers, the Vigenère Cipher is relatively easy to decipher, because a computer can quickly test out millions of words, and it can easily find the leaked information in the frequency analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### AES-128\n",
    "In the age of computers, ciphers must be hard to crack by a computer that can do trillions of calculations per second. Fortunately, cryptologists have invented encryption techniques that are secure in the digital world, and are continuing to improve them every year.\n",
    "One of the most common encryption standards is AES-128, a block cipher approved by the federal government and used often for secure file transfer. One reason is that each key is always 128 bits long. That means there are $2^{128}$ possible keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Andthere's more: the AES cipher requires applying a **sequence of 10 mathematical operations for each bit** of the key. Multiply that number above by 10, and that's the number of calculations a computer would need to do. The fastest computer would still take 500 trillion years to try every possible 128-bit key!\n",
    "\n",
    "What about frequency analysis? It won't work. The AES cipher does not reveal any information about the original text, thanks to the multi-step sequence of operations on blocks of bits.\n",
    "\n",
